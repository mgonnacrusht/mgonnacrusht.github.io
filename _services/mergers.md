Side projects and learning goals come with their own pile of tutorials, reference links, tools and examples. MgonnacrushT gives you a dedicated space to gather everything you need to stay motivated.

- Save docs, videos, repos, podcasts or quick text notes related to a goal.
- Tag by project (e.g. “app redesign”, “Spanish practice”, “D&D campaign”).
- Create focused lists for each project so you always know the next resource to open.
- Keep progress notes or “next steps” right alongside the materials you’ve saved.

Whether you’re teaching yourself something new or slowly building a product, you have a calm, searchable archive of the resources that matter to you.
