## Get in touch

If you’re interested in MgonnacrushT, have feedback, or want to hear when the early access version is ready, you’re very welcome to reach out.

### Reasons to contact

- You want to **try an early version** of the app when it’s ready.
- You have specific **use cases or workflows** you’d like the app to support.
- You’re curious about **partnerships or future API access**.
- Or you simply want to say “this is a problem I have too”.

### Email

For now, the simplest way to get in touch is email:

**mgonnacrusht@gmail.com**

### Early access & newsletter

There will be an **early access list** and possibly a small, low‑frequency newsletter sharing product updates, feature progress and behind‑the‑scenes notes.

Until a dedicated signup is live, just send a short email if you’d like to:

- Be notified when the first test versions are available.
- Share how you currently keep track of movies, places, links and ideas.
