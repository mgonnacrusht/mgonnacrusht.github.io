# SaveT – the MgonnacrushT product

SaveT is a personal bookmarking and organisation app built by MgonnacrushT for all the things you don’t want to forget online: media, places, links, ideas and more.

Instead of splitting your memory across multiple single‑purpose tools, MgonnacrushT gives you:

- One place to save things.
- One way to organise them.
- One interface to search and revisit them.

## How saving works

The first versions of the app will make it easy to **save items quickly**, without overthinking structure:

- Save a **link** (movie page, restaurant, article, product, video, etc.).
- Add an optional **title and note** so future you remembers why it mattered.
- Add **tags** like “watch”, “read later”, “restaurants‑London”, “board games”, “gift ideas”, “career” and more.

Over time, additional ways to save may be added, such as:

- Simple **text‑only items** (ideas without a URL).
- Support for **screenshots or images** where a visual reminder is more helpful.

The core principle is speed: it should feel natural to capture something in a few seconds and get back to what you were doing.

## How organisation works

Once items are saved, you’ll be able to shape them into something useful:

- **Tags** give you flexible, multi‑dimensional organisation (for example “London”, “friends”, “cozy”, “weekend”).
- **Filters** help you narrow down by type, tag or other properties.
- **Search** lets you jump straight to a specific item by title, note or tag.
- **Custom lists** (planned) will let you group items for specific goals: “2025 movies”, “restaurants for next trip”, “ideas for my next project”.

The aim is to make “what should I watch / do / read next?” easier to answer, using the things *you* already decided were worth saving.

## Cross‑device usage

From the beginning, SaveT is being designed as a **cross‑platform** tool.

- **Now / early stages:** focus on a solid mobile experience, so you can capture ideas when you’re out in the world or scrolling on your phone.
- **Later:** web and desktop access, so you can browse and organise from your laptop, plus a **browser extension** for one‑click saving while you work.

The long‑term goal is that your inbox of saved things feels the same across devices, without you having to think about syncing or version differences.

## Roadmap

### Phase 1 – Core bookmarking app (MVP, early access)

- Fast saving of links and basic items.
- Tags, notes and simple organisation.
- Search and filters.
- Sync and a reliable mobile experience.

This is the phase open to **early access users**, where feedback has the highest impact on what gets built next.

### Phase 2 – Sharing & collaboration

Once the core is stable, the focus shifts to how saved items can be shared:

- Shared lists for friends, families or small teams.
- Public lists for recommendations (for example “My London coffee guide”).
- Controlled collaboration so you can choose who can add or edit items.

The idea is to make it easy to plan trips, projects or watchlists together — without turning the app into a noisy social feed.

### Phase 3 – API, integrations & discovery

Longer‑term, there is room for more advanced power‑user and partner features:

- **API access** so other tools can integrate with your saved items (for example, personal dashboards or note‑taking apps).
- Simple **integrations** with popular services where it makes sense.
- Smarter **discovery features** that help surface relevant items from your own library, not random content.

All of these will be designed with privacy and control in mind, and may evolve based on how people actually use the core product.

## Pricing & future plans

### Current status

MgonnacrushT is currently **in development**. There is no public pricing yet, and the first versions will likely be limited to early access users while the basics are tested and improved.

### Pricing principles

Even though exact numbers and plans are not final, a few principles are clear:

- There will be a **generous free tier** that is genuinely useful on its own.
- Paid plans will be **simple and understandable**, without hidden catches.
- The goal is to charge fairly from people who get real, ongoing value from the app.

### Planned tiers (subject to change)

- **Free tier**
  - For casual use and trying out the app.
  - Enough capacity for most people’s everyday lists.

- **Pro / Premium tier** (planned)
  - For heavy users and people who want extra power.
  - Ideas include: more storage, advanced filters, priority support or experimental features.

- **Founding member options** (under consideration)
  - Possible early supporter options for people who want to back the project early.
  - If this happens, it will be clearly explained and optional.

Nothing here is final, and details will only be announced when the app is closer to a stable public release.
