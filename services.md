# SaveT - save it for later!
*See it! SaveT! Sort it!*


SaveT is a personal bookmarking and organisation app built by MgonnacrushT for all the things you don’t want to forget online: media, places, links, ideas and more.

Instead of splitting your memory across multiple single‑purpose tools, MgonnacrushT gives you:

- One place to save things.
- One way to organise them.
- One interface to search and revisit them.

## How saving works

The first versions of the app will make it easy to **save items quickly**, without overthinking structure:

- Save a **link** (movie page, restaurant, article, product, video, etc.).
- Add an optional **title and note** so future you remembers why it mattered.
- Add **tags** like “watch”, “read later”, “restaurants‑London”, “board games”, “gift ideas”, “career” and more. [tags will be in the future]

Over time, additional ways to save may be added, such as:

- Simple **text‑only items** (ideas without a URL).
- Support for **screenshots or images** where a visual reminder is more helpful.

The core principle is speed: it should feel natural to capture something in a few seconds and get back to what you were doing.

## Pricing & future plans

* The app will be free and contain minimal, non-disturbing advertising in its initial release.
* Afterwards, we plan to generate affiliate income from sales sites like Amazon by fetching product prices and tracking price features.
* It could be a membership system where we offer features like the price drop warning and the noads option to premium users, which we plan to add much later.
