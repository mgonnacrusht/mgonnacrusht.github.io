# SaveT - save it for later!
*See it! SaveT! Sort it!*


SaveT is a personal bookmarking and organisation app built by MgonnacrushT for all the things you don’t want to forget online: media, places, links, ideas and more.

Instead of splitting your memory across multiple single‑purpose tools, MgonnacrushT gives you:

- One place to save things.
- One way to organise them.
- One interface to search and revisit them.
## Pricing & future plans
* The app will be free and contain minimal, non-disturbing advertising in its initial release.
* Afterwards, we plan to generate affiliate income from sales sites like Amazon by fetching product prices and tracking price features.
* It could be a membership system where we offer features like the price drop warning and the noads option to premium users, which we plan to add much later.
