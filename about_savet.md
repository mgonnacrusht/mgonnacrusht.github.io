## The problem

We all save things we care about online: movies to watch, cafés to try, games to play, articles to read, videos to revisit and shopping ideas to remember.

But those lists end up **everywhere**:

- Movies on one app, TV shows on another.
- Board games buried in a BoardGameGeek list.
- Restaurants pinned in Google Maps or hidden in messages.
- Articles and videos lost in browser tabs, screenshots, notes and chat threads.
- Shopping ideas split between wishlists, carts and random notes.

Over time it becomes **messy and tiring**. You know you saved something “somewhere”, but finding it again takes more energy than it should. The tools are fragmented, and none of them are built for *all* the different kinds of things you want to remember.

## The solution

MgonnacrushT is a **single, cross-platform inbox** for everything you don’t want to forget on the internet.

Instead of juggling many different apps and a folder full of screenshots, you:

- Save any link, place, title or idea into one simple app.
- Add tags, notes and context so “future you” instantly remembers why it matters.
- Search, filter and browse your saved items across all categories in one place.
- Revisit smart lists that surface what you actually want to do or watch next.

The goal is not another social network or yet another to-do app. It’s a **calm, personal library** of things you care about, built by someone who has the same problem.

## Use cases

### Movies & TV

Keep a single list of films, series and specials you actually want to watch — no matter where you first saw them. Save titles from trailers, recommendations, social posts or articles, and tag them by genre, mood or who you plan to watch them with.

### Restaurants & cafés

Stop losing that great brunch spot or tiny coffee place in a sea of map pins and screenshots. Save restaurants and cafés with notes like “good for remote work”, “date night” or “near the station”, and find them again when you really need them.

### Articles & videos

Instead of 40 open tabs, scattered bookmarks and “I’ll watch this later” links, send everything into one place. Use tags like “deep dive”, “short read”, “design”, “productivity” or “career” so you can come back when you have the right kind of time.

### Shopping & wishlists

Collect ideas for things you might want to buy — books, gear, gifts, courses — without committing to a cart. Add notes about why you’re interested, compare options, and keep track of what’s a “maybe someday” versus “next purchase”.

### Personal projects & learning

Use MgonnacrushT as a reference library for side projects and learning goals. Group tutorials, tools, examples and inspiration around a specific skill or project, so you don’t have to rediscover the same resources over and over again.

## Planned features

### At first launch (MVP / early access)

The first version of the app will focus on doing a few core things well:

- **Fast saving** of links and simple text items.
- **Tags and basic fields** to organise your saved items.
- **Search and filters** to quickly find what you’re looking for.
- **Sync between devices** so your inbox is the same everywhere.

This is the phase where feedback from early users matters most, and where the product will change quickly based on real-world use.

### Later on (planned, not guaranteed)

Over time, the roadmap includes ideas like:

- **Shared and public lists** for recommendations, trip planning or project resources.
- **Collaboration features** so you can collect things together with friends, partners or teams.
- **Browser extension and web app** for saving from desktop in one click.
- **API access** for partners and power users who want to integrate with other tools.
- **Smarter discovery and recommendations** based on your own saved items and interests.

These plans may evolve, but the direction is clear: a focused, privacy-respecting tool that helps you keep track of the things that genuinely matter to you online.

## Early access & following the journey

MgonnacrushT is being built as a small, independent project — not a growth-at-all-costs startup.
