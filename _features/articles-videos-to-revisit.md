Forty open tabs, endless “read later” lists and DM’d links make it easy to lose great content. SaveT becomes your single inbox for anything you want to read, watch or listen to when you actually have time.
<!--more-->

- Save from mobile share sheets, desktop bookmarklets (planned) or plain copy/paste.
- Tag content by topic, length, mood or priority (e.g. “deep dive”, “quick listen”).
- Add notes about why it caught your eye or what you hope to learn.
- Use search and filters to pull up the right article or video at the right moment.

No more rediscovering the same threads or losing that brilliant talk you meant to watch.
