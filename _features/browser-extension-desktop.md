Saving from your phone is critical, but desktop browsing still accounts for a huge portion of online discovery. SaveT has a browser extension and full web app on the roadmap so you can capture and organise things wherever you are.

Planned improvements include:

- A lightweight browser button for Chrome/Brave/Edge/Firefox so you can save in one click.
- Keyboard-friendly workflows for power users who live in their browser.
- A responsive web experience for browsing, tagging and reorganising from larger screens.
- Context-aware fields that auto-fill details from the page you’re saving.

If you live in tabs all day and want to help test these features, send a note to mgonnacrusht@gmail.com — early testers will directly influence how the extension works.
