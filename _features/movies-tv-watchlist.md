Movies, series and documentaries end up scattered across Letterboxd lists, streaming watchlists, text messages and screenshots. SaveT gives you one calm space to keep track of everything you want to watch next.

- Save titles from any link, trailer or conversation in a couple of taps.
- Add tags like “cozy”, “with friends”, “award season” or “travel inspiration”.
- Keep short notes about who recommended it or where it’s available.
- Search and filter when you finally sit down to choose something.

It’s a simple way to keep a living watchlist without juggling five different apps.
