Looking further out, SaveT could become a platform other tools can hook into. That means respectful APIs, optional integrations and smarter recommendations built on the data you already trust the app with.

Concepts on the horizon:

- A secure API so you can sync your saved items with personal dashboards or notes.
- Integrations with tools you already use (shortcuts, task managers, calendars).
- Optional affiliate link helpers that keep disclosures clean and transparent.
- Recommendation features that surface your own forgotten gems, not generic trends.

These features will only roll out once the core experience is rock solid and privacy safeguards are fully in place.
