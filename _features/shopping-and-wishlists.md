Screenshots, saved carts and “maybe later” emails aren’t a great system for keeping track of the things you want to buy or gift. MgonnacrushT helps you build thoughtful wishlists without the pressure to check out immediately.

- Save product links, price info and inspiration images in seconds.
- Tag items by category, urgency, budget or who it’s for.
- Track notes like “compare with model X”, “watch for sales” or “gift for Emma”.
- Group items into lists for holidays, hobbies or future projects.

When you’re ready to make a decision you have the full context in one place, not scattered across dozens of shops and notes.
