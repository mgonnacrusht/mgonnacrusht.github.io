MgonnacrushT is starting as a personal inbox, but collaboration is on the roadmap. The plan is to let you collect things together with the people who matter most.

Ideas under exploration include:

- Shared lists for friends, partners, families or small teams.
- Public lists you can publish (e.g. “My Lisbon coffee map” or “Board games for rainy days”).
- Invite-only lists where you decide who can add or edit items.
- Lightweight comments or reactions so you can keep context without turning it into a social feed.

Nothing ships until it feels helpful and respectful, but if you’re interested in any of these features please reach out — early conversations shape what gets built.
