Map pins, bookmarked TikToks and random notes are not a reliable way to remember where you want to eat next. SaveT keeps all of your food and coffee ideas in one tidy list.

- Save places straight from Google Maps links, articles, socials or plain text.
- Tag by city, neighbourhood, cuisine, budget or who you want to go with.
- Keep small notes like “great pastries”, “quiet weekday spot” or “need reservation”.
- Filter by mood or location when you’re actually trying to pick somewhere.

It’s the easiest way to stop losing great recommendations and finally try the spots people keep telling you about.
